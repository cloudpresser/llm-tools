Your job is to analyze the following part of a git diff and provide a concise summary.

Git Diff Part:
${batchDiff}

Focus on:
1. Files changed: List all files that were modified, added, or deleted.
2. Key changes: For each file, describe the key changes:
   - For added/deleted files, mention their purpose.
   - For modified files, explain what functionality was altered.
3. Significant changes: Highlight any significant code changes, such as:
   - New functions or methods added
   - Major changes to existing functions
   - Changes in data structures or algorithms
4. Dependencies: Note any changes to dependencies or configuration files.
5. Performance: Mention any changes related to performance improvements or optimizations.
6. Error Handling: Point out any changes in error handling or logging.
7. Security: Identify any changes related to security (if applicable).
8. RefactorsIdentify any refactors.

IMPORTANT: Omit unused or unnaplicable headers (Do not list 7 if it's empty)

Example:
1. Files changed:
'index.js'
'package.json'
2. Key changes
index.js was refactored to be more in line with the current architecture
package.json had a new package added
3. Significant changes
indext.js had it's structure changed
4. Dependencies
next, a react full stack framework was added as a dependency
8. Refactors
index.js wa refactored
